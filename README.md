**Semester**: AY24/25 Sem 2  
**Project**: Crop Yield Prediction Using Regression Models
**Assessment Type**: Computer-Based Assessment (Individual Project)

## 📘 Project Description
This project is based on a case scenario from the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare in India. The goal is to build predictive models to estimate crop yield using historical agricultural and environmental data. Three modeling techniques were evaluated:

- Linear Regression  
- MARS (Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines)  
- Random Forest 

---

## 📁 Structure
- `code/` - R script for preprocessing and modeling
- `question/` - Case questions and background
- `docs/` - Final report and summary of findings
- `data/` - Raw dataset

---

## 🧪 Project Tasks Overview

### 🔍 Part A: Data Exploration & Research Questions (30%)
- Explored crop yield patterns across crop types, states, weather conditions, and agricultural inputs.
- Proposed 2 research questions and outlined methods to answer them.

### 🤖 Part B: Model Building & Evaluation (40%)
- Trained models using pre-2018 data, tested on 2018 and beyond.
- Compared Linear Regression, MARS, and Random Forest.
- Evaluated using RMSE and R².
- Answered the 2 research questions using model results.

### 🧠 Part C: Insights & Recommendations (30%)
- Summarised key findings, trends, and strategic recommendations to the Ministry.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- R (with `earth`, `randomForest`, `caret`)
- RStudio

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open `code/crop_yield_analytics.R` in RStudio.
2. Install required packages if not already available.
3. Retrieve raw input dataset in `data/`.
4. Run the script to reproduce the analysis and models.
